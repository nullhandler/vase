## Vase : Privacy policy

Vase : Simplify, Track and Control your finance.

Being passionate user(s) of Android ourself, We place great importance on safeguarding privacy. We understand the frustration that arises when applications gather your information without your awareness.

Therefore, we affirm, based on my understanding and conviction, that I have not designed this application to acquire any personally identifiable data. Any preferences regarding the app, such as themes, generated by you (the user), are exclusively stored on your device. Removing the app's data or uninstalling it will easily eliminate these preferences.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions/Intents required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

<br/>
